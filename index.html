            <h3>Why Morocco?</h3>
            <p>
              Present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least
              Paleolithic times. Some research suggests inhabitants have
              been there since early Homo Sapiens roughly 315,000 years
              ago. This extensive history makes Morocco a country with a
              rich culture and civilisation. Through its' history, it has
              hosted many people coming from East (Phoenicians, Jews and
              Arabs), South (Sub-Saharan Africans) and North (Romans,
              Andalusians). All those civilisations have affected the
              social structure of Morocco.
            </p>
            <p>
              Morocco is widely varied in architecture, art, and cuisine.
              Morocco's architecture is incredibly diverse, influenced by
              the ancient Romans it once hosted as well as more modern
              influences of French and Spanish design. <br />Moroccan
              cuisine is considered one of the most diversified cuisines in
              the world. In this fusion of Moorish, European and
              Mediterranean cuisines, there are many incredible, flavorful
              dishes to explore. Try a

              Hi! My name is Ligia and my brief adventure to Morocco was
              one of the best trips I've ever taken! I hope to inspire you
              to explore Morocco one day too! I created this project as
              part of SheCodes bootcamp to showcase both coding skills and
              a small snapshot of an amazing country ❤
